## What's going on here 

Hey, sooo this is some kind of a blog, except that I'm not going to talk about myself. I want to talk about "interesting things" and when I say intersting I mean interesting FOR ME. 

### Food :p 

First, let's talk about food, I'm currently in Bretagne in France so I am going to talk about "la cuisine bretonne" ! 
One thing you need to know about people living there, "les bretons" is that they loooooove butter, I am not kidding, they litteraly have a dessert in which butter represent more than 1/4 of the ingredients. This dessert is called a kouign-amann and its name litteraly means : butter cake ! haha 
Here you can find a recipe
